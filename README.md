# Ideas on what to program

***

1. YouTunes

- I am a type of person, that still refuses to use online streaming services for music, so still a classic iTunes guy. Most of the time, I download the music I like directly from Youtube with a downloader and put it in iTunes.
- So far, so good but I really hate the inefficient way of renaming every single file (the recommended name by the downloader is of course not suitable for iTunes) for iTunes itself, so it gets properly displayed on the iPhone.
- Goal: To have a program which downloads the youtube music (maybe also complete albums) and then gives me an ability to rename all the files more automatically with their title. In best case, the program should also look automatically for a music cover of the title or album for iTunes (maybe this could be a little bit more complicated).

2. Tracking

- I really like to track things. I am also tracking my gym training and the money i am spending on a monthly basis.

- ATM, everything gets tracked in several EXCEL tables (a little boring if you ask me), so I could build a GUI for my tracking and store the information in a database
