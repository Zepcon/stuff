I really like to hit Win + R and then just type a command to start a file i am using often.
In oder to do this you need to have a batch file with the commands name in the C:\Windows folder.

This tool just creates this batch file with the command name and the Path to the file/ program you want to open.

Example:
    1) I just want to open my Windows Documents by hitting Win + R -> "d" -> enter
    2) "d" is the name of the command
    3) path is just "Dokumente"
    4) Move the created file to "C:\Windows" (admin rights needed) and it should work
